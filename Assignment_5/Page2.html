        I will start this point with an interesting statistics. According to
        surveys done by Akamai and Gomez.com, 47% of the web users expect a web
        page to load in 2 seconds or less and 40% of people abandon a website
        that takes more than 3 seconds to load.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just think about this, if your website loading time is more than 3
        seconds then you are losing almost half of your visitors without even
        having a look to your website. Your website loading time must be less
        than 3 seconds.

        There are numerous reasons that can increase your website loading time.
        I will outline some of the common reasons here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using too many plugins</li>
        <li>Excessive use of flash</li>
        <li>Broken links</li>
        <li>Bad coding</li>
        <li>Images are too big in size</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many techniques, both from a design and coding aspect can be applied to
        your website for faster loading. Some of the techniques are given below-
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Don’t use too many plugins</li>
        <li>Optimize your images</li>
        <li>Reduce server response time</li>
        <li>Minimize HTTP Requests</li>
        <li>Reduce redirects</li>
