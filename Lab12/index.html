         <p>Fruits are packed with essential vitamins and minerals. For example, citrus fruits like oranges and lemons
            are high in Vitamin C, which supports the immune system, while bananas are rich in potassium, which helps
            regulate blood pressure. Including a variety of fruits ensures that your body gets a diverse range of

         <h3>2. High in Fiber</h3>
         <p>Many fruits are an excellent source of dietary fiber. Fiber is crucial for maintaining healthy digestion and
            preventing constipation. Fruits like apples, pears, and berries contain a high amount of fiber, promoting a
            healthy gut and aiding in the reduction of cholesterol levels.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>3. Natural Source of Antioxidants</h3>
         <p>Fruits like berries, grapes, and oranges are rich in antioxidants. These compounds help protect the body
            from oxidative stress, which can lead to chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
            Antioxidants also slow down the aging process and promote overall cellular health.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>4. Hydration</h3>
         <p>Fruits have a high water content, helping keep the body hydrated. Watermelon, cantaloupe, and oranges, for
            instance, have over 80% water content, making them an excellent option for staying hydrated, especially
            during hot weather or after physical activity.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>5. Low in Calories, High in Energy</h3>
         <p>Most fruits are low in calories but provide a quick energy boost due to their natural sugars. They make for
            a perfect snack, especially for those looking to manage their weight while maintaining energy levels.
            Bananas, for example, are a favorite among athletes for providing sustained energy.
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>6. Supports Heart Health</h3>
         <p>Eating fruits can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Fruits like berries, avocados, and citrus
            fruits are known for their heart-healthy nutrients, such as potassium, fiber, and antioxidants, which can
            lower blood pressure, improve cholesterol levels, and reduce inflammation in the body.
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>7. Boosts Immunity</h3>
         <p>Vitamin-rich fruits, especially those high in Vitamin C like oranges, strawberries, and kiwi, strengthen the
            immune system. Regular consumption of these fruits can help the body fight off infections and illnesses more
            effectively.
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>8. Promotes Skin Health</h3>
         <p>Fruits such as mangoes, oranges, and papayas are rich in vitamins A and C, which are crucial for healthy
            skin. They help in collagen production, keeping the skin firm, reducing wrinkles, and providing a natural
            glow.
         </p>
      </div>
      <div class="fact">
         <h3>9. Improves Mental Health</h3>
         <p>Certain fruits can have positive effects on mental well-being. Berries, rich in antioxidants, have been
            shown to support brain health, reduce cognitive decline, and improve memory. The natural sugars in fruits
            can also elevate mood and provide mental clarity.
